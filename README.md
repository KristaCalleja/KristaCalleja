### Hello world! 👋

My passion for using tech tools to create functional and beautiful apps was kindled following completion of an intensive web development bootcamp which I took in late 2019 (Le Wagon, Batch #330 Rio de Janeiro campus). Since then I have been seething with ideas for applications and designs to contribute in the tech world.
Prior to this path, I made a living through legal consultancy in the area of fisheries and environmental law.
