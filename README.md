### Hello world! 👋

<img width="775" alt="profile" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40354833/111623219-d7e12e80-87c8-11eb-928c-3a34d44826c9.png">

My passion for using tech tools to create functional and beautiful apps was kindled following completion of an intensive web development bootcamp which I took in late 2019 (Le Wagon, Batch #330 Rio de Janeiro campus). Since then I have been seething with ideas for applications and designs to contribute in the tech world.
Prior to this path, I made a living through legal consultancy in the area of fisheries and environmental law. 

### Tools I use:
- ⌨️ HTML5, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Ruby, SQL
- 🌱 I’m currently self-learning React.js 

### More about me:
- 🗺 I was born in 🇲🇹 (EU) but I consider myself a citizen of the world. In the last 10 years I lived in Italy, Belgium, Brazil and Switzerland.
- 📚 I'm an avid fiction reader: https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9676019-krista-calleja
- ☕️ Fun fact: I volunteer as a book club organiser in my community
- 📱 My dream project: building a fully-functional app in my native tongue 🇲🇹
